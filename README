ROM Patcher:
This is a basic ROM Patcher for android that supports IPS, IPS32, BPS, 
UPS, XDELTA1, XDELTA3, PPF, DPS, ASM, DLDI, APS, and BSDIFF patch files. It 
can also 
decompress ECM files. This is also the first open source rom patcher to support the IPS32 patch type. This project is 
licensed under GPLv3, with all components under some form of GPL with 
the exception of UPS (Public domain with one exception, see source) and 
BSDIFF
(custom license, see source)
These components were ported from a Mac OSX rom patcher called 
MultiPatch
